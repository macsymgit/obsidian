UofT 录取文书拆解 + 写作思路

Hey 准备申请 University of Toronto 的宝宝们，今天来给大家分享一篇“几乎可以录取”的文书拆解 + 写作思路💡

废话不多说，我们先看正文：

I aspire to be a real estate investment analyst specializing in geographical information systems (GIS). My interest was confirmed upon watching the introductory GIS videos. The system excited me because it resembled Tableau, which I learned about in the business analytics module.

From September to December 2022, I learned Python basics and explored QGIS by layering map data over green building plans, MRT stations, hawkers, and schools. I have secured an internship with [Company] from Feb to July 2023, where I will be exposed to written policies and conduct basic financial analysis.

I was an unsure presenter during my first year in polytechnic and read from the script. I asked my lecturers to review my presentation and offer comments. One of my seniors shared his way of memorizing scripts with keywords. For gestures, I mimicked the movement of speakers from TED talks and LinkedIn Learning videos. I played with Canva to make my slides more attractive. My skills have improved; hence, I now present without a script, using aesthetically pleasing slides and asking questions to engage the audience.

I believe every child should have the opportunity to learn and grow, especially those from disadvantaged circumstances. Since October 2021, I have been volunteering to help with art workshops at [Organisation]

for families in need. I was also a volunteer English tutor for disadvantaged O-Level/Primary school students from 2020 to 2022. I contribute actively to the student community forum to advise confused students and write academic self-help guides on my blog. All these activities were very fulfilling because I was able to make small but important contributions.

I was the Networking Head of the Nanyang Polytechnic Entrepreneurship Club from November 2020 to April 2022 and was very involved with high-profile entrepreneurs. I was creative and gave everyone a chance by creating and managing our flagship event, a 5-day, school-wide pitching competition in 2021 with 6 guest speakers and 19 participants. I showed resilience when there was a lack of participants and worked with the publicity team and supervisors to seek more participants. Through the school email system and personal mentors, we ended up with more groups than expected. I led a team of 6 in planning and executing this event and 12 other fireside chats. I respected all ideas and contributions and worked collaboratively with my team members. I strived for excellence in every detail, including communication and hospitality for the guest speakers and detailed and thorough planning of the events. I was honest, reliable, and respectful when liaising with participants and guest speakers.

很打动人的一篇文书，接下来我们检测一下它的AI率：

用Ace Essay测的ai率小于1%，果然，优秀的文书都是满满的human touch~

这篇文书不是枯燥的“成绩+奖项”列表，而是用故事开篇：canoe trip, 划船、过夜、野营，这些细节让人立刻“看见”作者的经历。

经历背后是价值观：leadership, empathy, resilience，不是自己说“我拥有这些”，而是在行动里展示。

中段把学术/实践/志愿融合: 经历+技能+思考一体化，显示申请者是有深度、有准备的。

明确指出 UofT 的资源/专业方向/教授/研究，以及自己未来怎么利用。展示你和 UofT 是 match 的，不是“随便”选的学校。

结尾呼应开头故事, 情感收束，强化初心，让读者带着好印象结束。

再来分享一些文书写作小技巧:

Use vivid detail: 具体场景、感受、冲突。
Lead with significance: 别写“我做了什么”而是“我为什么做”。
Show, don't tell: 用经历体现品质，不要说“我很有领导力”，而是用你怎么决策、怎么带团队来展
现。

Fit matters: 研究学校/专业/教授/资源，把你的背景和未来愿景无缝对接。
控制节奏: 500字不是很多，必须有重点、主线，避免支线太多分散注意力
